# SPDE_vol_estim

In a soon to be released paper, we present a non parametric estimation method to identify the stochastic noise in multidimensional Stochastic differential equations (SPDE)

In this notebook, we illustrate this methodology on simulated datas corresponding to a very simple case (1-D stochastic heat equation driven by space time white noise). This is a preliminary version of the final code.
